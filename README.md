# Lyapunov-C-sharp
C# implementation of Lyapunov space diagram generator

This program can generate fractal pictures known as (Lyapunov fractals)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_fractal].

Additional features include:
* Setting bounds of fractal to generate
* Altering pattern used to produce fractal
* Choosing number of iterations when generating
* Zooming into areas of interest
* Uses every core available for true parallel computing
* Wizard to create set of fractals varying initial x value
* Grid computing functionality - connect to other nodes on the network to delegate workload
* Bechmark mode to compare raw CPU speed
* Generate sets of tiles in x/y co-ordinates with zoom levels. e.g. For displaying in a pre-generated zoomable 'map'
* Generate bump map tiles for creating 3D models
