You can use it to display any portion of Lyapunov space for any pattern of applying the formulae and then zoom in further using as many iterations as you wish, using as many cores as available. In addition there is a wizard to produce a set of graphs by choosing to vary one of the paramaters. Aswell as all that you can link many LyapunovGenerators together running on multiple computers across a network to share out the workload for a large generation.")]
